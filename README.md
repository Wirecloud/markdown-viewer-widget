The Markdown viewer widget is a [WireCloud widget](http://wirecloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) that provides the
ability to display markdown formatted texts. Example usage of this widget could be to display a "readme" for a workspace
so other users can understand the dashboard.

## Build

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](http://node.js) and [Bower](http://bower.io) in your system. For example, you can
install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the following commands:

```console
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g bower
```

Install other npm dependencies by running: (need root because some libraries use applications, check package.json before
to be sure)

```console
sudo npm install
```

In order to build this widget you need to download grunt:

```console
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And now, you can use grunt:

```console
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `dist` folder.

## Documentation

Documentation about how to use this widget is available on the [User Guide](src/doc/userguide.md). Anyway, you can find
general information about how to use widgets on the
